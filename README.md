# Text translation, currency conversion, unit conversion, music lyrics, COVID-19 statistics. This bot has it all, all live-time and with 0 setup.

**Our vision is that bots should be instantly ready you moment you invite them and that features should be useful, reliable, and original.** Whenever users type a `*command name`, they will always know that the output is correct without the need to ever double-check. Because we the developers do the heavy work.
